## 🎮 Task
Optimize all audio & image assets in the project by:

- Converting all audio files to .mp3
- Converting all images (.png, .jpg, etc.) to .webp
- Ensure that images with transparent backgrounds keep their transparency intact
- Remove original unneeded formats only after verifying that everything works properly
- Preserve visual & audio quality while reducing file sizes

## 🎯 Objectives
✅ Convert all audio (.wav) → .mp3 at efficient bitrate  
✅ Convert all images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) → .webp  
✅ Preserve transparency in .png files when converting to .webp  
✅ Ensure all assets still work seamlessly in the game  
✅ Backup originals for rollback if needed  
✅ Test thoroughly before deleting old files  

## 📄 Guidelines

### 🎵 Audio
Convert every .wav to .mp3 with:

- Background Music: 128–160 kbps
- Sound Effects: 96–128 kbps (mono if stereo isn’t required)
- Keep loop points intact for looping tracks

Example ffmpeg command:  
ffmpeg -i input.wav -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k output.mp3

### 🖼 Images
Convert all .png, .jpg, .jpeg → .webp

- Detect images with transparent backgrounds (usually .png)
- Ensure these retain alpha channel when converting to .webp

Example cwebp command for transparent images:  
cwebp -q 80 -alpha_q 80 input.png -o output.webp  
*(adjust -q and -alpha_q as needed for balance of quality & size)*

- Replace image references in code (HTML/CSS/JS) to point to .webp versions

## 🧪 Safety Measures
🔒 Backup all original assets before conversion  
👀 Test game thoroughly after replacing files  
🎨 Specifically review converted transparent images for visual correctness  
📝 Check all audio playback & loops for correctness  
🗂 Delete old files only after full QA pass  

## 🔧 Suggested Tools
- Audio: Audacity, ffmpeg
- Images: cwebp, imagemin, Squoosh CLI

## 🪄 Deliverables
- Fully optimized assets (.mp3 + .webp with transparency preserved)
- Backup of originals
- Updated code referencing the new file formats
- Brief report of file size savings & issues (if any)
