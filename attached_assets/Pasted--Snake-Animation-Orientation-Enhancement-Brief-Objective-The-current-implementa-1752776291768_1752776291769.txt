# 🐍 Snake Animation Orientation Enhancement Brief

---

## 🎯 Objective
The current implementation successfully uses the correct sprite sheet slices and assigns them to the appropriate snake segments (head, body, tail) in the game.  
However, the movement animation still appears incorrect because the segments are not properly **rotated or oriented** to match the snake's moving direction.

In the attached screenshot, you can see:
- The segments (head, body, tail) are placed in the right order.
- But their orientations don’t follow the snake’s actual path or turning.

## 🛠️ Required Enhancements
To make the animation visually correct and smooth:
1. Implement logic to dynamically **rotate and orient each segment** according to:
   - The direction of movement of the snake at each step.
   - The relative positions of adjacent segments (to decide if a segment is straight, turning, head, or tail, and at what angle).

2. Specifically:
   - **Head:** Rotate to face the direction of the next move.
   - **Body (straight):** Rotate horizontal or vertical depending on path.
   - **Body (turn):** Rotate to form the correct corner (e.g., up→right, right→down, etc.).
   - **Tail:** Rotate to point toward the preceding segment.

## 📐 Suggested Logic
- At each game tick:
  - For each segment:
    - Identify the previous and next positions of the segment in the snake array.
    - Determine if the segment is:
      - Start (head) → face toward next segment.
      - End (tail) → face toward previous segment.
      - Middle → check if path is straight (same row or same column) or a corner (change in both row & column).
  - Based on the above, assign the correct slice **and rotate it appropriately (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)**.

## 👥 Outcome
✅ Head, body, and tail not only appear in correct order but also **face the correct directions**.  
✅ Smooth and visually coherent snake movement animation.  
✅ Supports all turns and directional changes seamlessly.

## 🚀 Deliverables
- Updated code logic to calculate segment orientations each frame.
- Integrated rotation/orientation mechanism with the rendering engine.
- QA to test all corner cases (turns, reversals, quick direction changes).
