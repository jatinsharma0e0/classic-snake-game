# 🐍 Snake Game Final Bug Fixes & Stability Enhancement

---

## 🎯 Objective
We are very close to a polished and stable game experience — the sprite slicing, segment placement, and most animations are working well.  
However, two critical issues remain that must be addressed to finalize the game logic and ensure a flawless experience.

## 🛠️ Issues to Fix

### 1️⃣ Tail Orientation Bug
- **Current State:**  
  All segments (head, body, turns) are behaving properly and oriented correctly — except the **tail segment**, which does not properly face the preceding body segment.
- **Expected Behavior:**  
  The tail should rotate/orient itself to face toward the segment it follows, correctly aligning with the snake’s direction of motion.
- **Task:**  
  - Implement a specific check for the tail segment.
  - Determine the relative position of the second-last segment to the tail.
  - Rotate the tail slice to point toward that segment (0°, 90°, 180°, 270° as appropriate).

### 2️⃣ Unexpected Game Over State
- **Current State:**  
  Occasionally, the game triggers a **Game Over screen** randomly while the player is actively playing, even though the snake has not collided with a wall, obstacle, or itself.
- **Expected Behavior:**  
  The Game Over condition should only trigger when:
  - The snake’s head collides with itself.
  - The snake’s head moves beyond the game area (wall collision).
  - Any defined obstacle collision occurs.
- **Task:**  
  - Review the collision detection logic thoroughly.
  - Identify and fix any faulty conditions or misfires that trigger the Game Over state incorrectly.
  - Test edge cases (tight turns, quick direction changes, rapid growth) to ensure no false positives.

## 🚀 Deliverables
✅ Tail segment rotation logic fixed and working correctly in all scenarios.  
✅ Game Over screen appears **only when a legitimate collision occurs**.  
✅ Comprehensive testing of all edge cases to ensure no regressions or unexpected issues remain.  
✅ Confirmation that the game remains stable and playable after fixes.
