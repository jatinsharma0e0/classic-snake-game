Critical Errors Found:
1. Duplicate Game Initialization

Lines 2374-2376: window.addEventListener('load', () => { new SnakeGame(); });
Lines 2420: gameInstance = new SnakeGame();
Issue: Game gets initialized TWICE - once on window load and once after asset loading
Result: Memory leaks, duplicate event listeners, conflicting game instances
2. Missing Audio Manager Integration

Line 80: this.audioManager = new AudioManager();
Issue: AudioManager class is referenced but never defined in the attached code
Result: Game will crash with "AudioManager is not defined" error
3. Asset Loader Dependency Missing

Lines 2393, 2409, 2433: References to window.assetLoader
Issue: AssetLoader is used but not defined in attached code
Result: Loading screen will break, assets won't load properly
4. Conflicting Rendering Methods

Line 1231: drawSnakeBodyOptimized() method exists
Line 1395: drawSnakeBody() method also exists
Issue: Two different snake body rendering methods, unclear which is being used
5. Incomplete Object Pool Implementation

Lines 2332-2341: initializeObjectPools() method defined
Issue: Method is defined but never called in constructor or anywhere else
Result: Performance optimizations won't work
6. Unused/Orphaned Code

Lines 2175-2273: Apple animation system that doesn't integrate with main game
Issue: This appears to be leftover code from start screen animations
Result: Dead code that adds confusion and bloat
7. Missing Method Calls

Line 199: this.setupInteractionRestrictions(); called but method not found in attached code
Line 201: this.setupOptimizedKeyboardHandling(); called but overridden by duplicate setup
Result: Some features may not work as expected
8. Inconsistent Canvas Setup

Lines 4-9: Canvas context with specific optimization flags
Issue: Context optimization may conflict with certain rendering operations
Recommendations to Fix:
Remove duplicate initialization - Keep only one game initialization method
Add missing AudioManager class or remove audio references
Add missing AssetLoader class or simplify loading system
Choose one snake rendering method and remove the other
Call initializeObjectPools() in constructor if needed
Remove unused apple animation code
Add missing method implementations
Test canvas context optimizations for compatibility
The code has good structure and performance optimizations, but these errors will prevent it from running properly. The main issues are missing dependencies and duplicate initialization that could cause crashes.
