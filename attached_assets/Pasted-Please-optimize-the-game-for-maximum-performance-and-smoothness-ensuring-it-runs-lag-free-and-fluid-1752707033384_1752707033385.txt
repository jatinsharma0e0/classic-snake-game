Please optimize the game for maximum performance and smoothness, ensuring it runs lag-free and fluid even on low-end devices (e.g., older smartphones, tablets, or low-spec PCs).

ðŸŽ® Goals:
Maintain a stable frame rate (target 60 FPS if possible) across all supported devices.

Minimize CPU, GPU, and memory usage during gameplay.

Reduce load times and keep resource usage as low as possible.

ðŸ“ˆ Optimizations to consider:
Optimize the render loop: minimize expensive computations inside the animation/game loop.

Batch or minimize draw calls; reduce DOM operations if using Canvas/DOM hybrid.

Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations instead of setInterval or setTimeout.

Minimize and reuse objects to reduce garbage collection pressure and avoid memory leaks.

Use efficient data structures and avoid unnecessary recalculations.

Optimize image assets: compress textures/sprites and use appropriate resolutions for target devices.

Avoid overdraw and excessive alpha transparency where possible.

If using Canvas or WebGL: clear and redraw only whatâ€™s necessary each frame, not the entire screen unnecessarily.

Debounce or throttle non-critical event listeners and input handlers.

Lazy-load non-essential resources and clean up resources properly when not in use.

Profile the game on real low-end devices and identify bottlenecks (e.g., via Chrome DevTools Performance tab).

ðŸ“± Mobile-specific:
Reduce layout thrashing, style recalculations, and heavy CSS effects.

Minimize the use of large shadows, filters, and high-frequency DOM updates.

Keep touch interactions responsive and lightweight.

Optimize audio to ensure it doesnâ€™t block or stutter on weaker processors.

Notes:
Keep the game visually consistent and preserve the playful, cartoonish feel while applying optimizations.

Ensure that no optimizations break the gameplay logic or animations.

The goal is to deliver a smooth, enjoyable experience across all devices, including older and lower-spec hardware, while maintaining the cartoonish charm of the game.
